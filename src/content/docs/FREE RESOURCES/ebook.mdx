    "A Tale of Two Cities" by Charles Dickens is a historical novel written in the mid-19th century. Set against the backdrop of the French Revolution, the story opens with an exploration of the social and political turmoil of the time, introducing key themes such as resurrection, sacrifice, and the dichotomy between oppression and liberty. The narrative begins with the character Mr. Jarvis Lorry's journey, who is on a mission to retrieve Dr. Alexandre Manette, an imprisoned former physician, who has been "recalled to life" after years of suffering. The opening of the novel vividly depicts the contrasting conditions in England and France, emphasizing the hardships faced by common people. A detailed scene unfolds as Mr. Lorry, traveling on a Dover mail coach, encounters a mysterious messenger who brings him a message related to Dr. Manette. As Mr. Lorry arrives in Paris, we sense ominous undertones of the Revolution as Madame Defarge’s wine shop symbolizes the brewing discontent. The narrative hints at the challenges ahead as characters intertwine in a story of personal and political upheaval, setting the stage for the unfolding drama that explores the quest for justice in the face of tyranny.

Curious, Alice pursues the Rabbit and finds herself tumbling down a deep rabbit hole, leading to a curious hall filled with doors, all locked. After experiencing a series of bizarre changes in size from eating and drinking mysterious substances, she begins exploring this new world, initially frustrated by her newfound challenges as she navigates her size and the peculiar inhabitants she meets.

    <summary>Book Summary</summary>
        "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story is mainly narrated by Nick Carraway, who reflects on the life of his enigmatic neighbor, Jay Gatsby, and the extravagant world of wealth and excess he inhabits. The novel explores themes of the American Dream, love, and social class. At the start of the novel, Nick Carraway reflects on advice from his father about withholding judgment of others, which sets the stage for the unfolding narrative. We learn about Nick's background, his move to West Egg, and his connection to wealthy acquaintances like Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Nick's first glimpse of Gatsby is during a moment of solitude when he sees Gatsby reaching out toward a distant green light, symbolizing his unattainable dreams. This opening portion lays the groundwork for the intricate relationships and social dynamics in the world of 1920s America, hinting at the luxurious yet hollow lives that many characters lead.
