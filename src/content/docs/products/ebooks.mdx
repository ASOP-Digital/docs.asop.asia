            Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start
             dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed 
             in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, 
             they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then,
              on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man
               called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry
                Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of 
                Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin!

        When the Knight Bus crashes through the darkness and screeches to a halt 
        in front of him, it's the start of another far from ordinary year at 
        Hogwarts for Harry Potter. Sirius Black, escaped mass-murderer and 
        follower of Lord Voldemort, is on the run - and they say he is coming 
        after Harry. In his first ever Divination class, Professor Trelawney sees
         an omen of death in Harry's tea leaves... But perhaps most terrifying 
         of all are the Dementors patrolling the school grounds, with their 
         soul-sucking kiss.

        The official playscript of the original West End production 
        of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. It was always difficult 
        being Harry Potter and it isn't much easier now that he is an 
        overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father 
        of three school-age children. While Harry grapples with a past that 
        refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle
         with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present
          fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: 
          sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places. The playscript for
           Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was originally released as a 'special
            rehearsal edition' alongside the opening of Jack Thorne's play in London's
             West End in summer 2016. Based on an original story by J.K. Rowling, 
             John Tiffany and Jack Thorne, the play opened to rapturous reviews 
             from theatregoers and critics alike, while the official playscript 
             became an immediate global bestseller. This revised paperback edition 
             updates the 'special rehearsal edition' with the conclusive 
             and final dialogue from the play, which has subtly changed 
             since its rehearsals, as well as a conversation piece between 
             director John Tiffany and writer Jack Thorne, who share stories and 
             insights about reading playscripts. This edition also includes 
             useful background information including the Potter family tree 
             and a timeline of events from the wizarding world prior to the 
             beginning of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.
